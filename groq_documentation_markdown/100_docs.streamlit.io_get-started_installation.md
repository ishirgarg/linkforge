# Install Streamlit
There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit. Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most common scenario.

### Tip
Try a Streamlit Playground that runs in your browser â€” no installation required. (Note that this is not how Streamlit is meant to be used, because it has many downsides. That's why it's a _playground_!)
[Instructions for the playground](/get-started/installation/streamlit-playground)

## Summary for experienced Python developers
1. To set up your Python environment and test your installation, execute the following terminal commands:
    ```bash
pip install streamlit streamlit hello
```
2. Jump to our [Basic concepts](/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts).

## Install Streamlit on your machine
### Option 1: I like the command line
Install Streamlit on your own machine using tools like `venv` and `pip`.

### Option 2: I prefer a graphical interface
Install Streamlit using the Anaconda Distribution graphical user interface. This is also the best approach if you're on Windows or don't have Python set up.

## Create an app in the cloud
### Option 1: I want a free cloud environment
Use Streamlit Community Cloud with GitHub Codespaces so you don't have to go through the trouble of installing Python and setting up an environment.

### Option 2: I need something secure, controlled, and in the cloud
Use Streamlit in Snowflake to code your apps in the cloud, right alongside your data with role-based access controls.
