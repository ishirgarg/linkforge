### Deploy Streamlit apps in Snowflake
Host your apps alongside your data in a single, global platform. Snowflake provides industry-leading features that ensure the highest levels of security for your account, users, data, and apps. If you're looking for an enterprise hosting solution, try Snowflake!

#### Streamlit in Snowflake Quickstart
Create a free trial account and deploy an app with Streamlit in Snowflake: [/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake?slug=deploy&slug=snowflake](/get-started/installation/streamlit-in-snowflake?slug=deploy&slug=snowflake)

#### Examples

There are three ways to host Streamlit apps in Snowflake:
1. **Streamlit in Snowflake**: Run your Streamlit app as a native object in Snowflake. Enjoy an in-browser editor and minimal work to configure your environment. Share your app with other users in your Snowflake account through role-based access control (RBAC). [https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit)
2. **Snowflake Native Apps**: Package your app with data and share it with other Snowflake accounts. [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit)
3. **Snowpark Container Services**: Deploy your app in a container that's optimized to run in Snowflake. [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview)

#### Note
Using Snowpark Container Services to deploy a Streamlit app requires a compute pool, which is not available in a trial account at this time.
