# Session State
Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store and persist state, Streamlit also exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks. Session state also persists across apps inside a [multipage app](/develop/concepts/multipage-apps).

## Initialize values in Session State
The Session State API follows a field-based API, which is very similar to Python dictionaries:
```python
# Initialization
if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['key'] = 'value'
# Session State also supports attribute based syntax
if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.key = 'value'
```

## Reads and updates
Read the value of an item in Session State and display it by passing to `st.write` :
```python
# Read
st.write(st.session_state.key)
# Outputs: value
```
Update an item in Session State by assigning it a value:
```python
st.session_state.key = 'value2'
# Attribute API
st.session_state['key'] = 'value2'
# Dictionary like API
```

## Delete items
Delete items in Session State using the syntax to delete items in any Python dictionary:
```python
# Delete a single key-value pair
del st.session_state[key]
# Delete all the items in Session state
for key in st.session_state.keys():
    del st.session_state[key]
```
Session State can also be cleared by going to Settings → Clear Cache, followed by Rerunning the app.

## Session State and Widget State association
Every widget with a key is automatically added to Session State:
```python
st.text_input("Your name", key="name")
# This exists now: st.session_state.name
```

## Use Callbacks to update Session State
A callback is a python function which gets called when an input widget changes.

### Order of execution
When updating Session state in response to **events**, a callback function gets executed first, and then the app is executed from top to bottom.

### Parameters
*   **on_change** or **on_click** - The function name to be used as a callback
*   **args** (_tuple_) - List of arguments to be passed to the callback function
*   **kwargs** (_dict_) - Named arguments to be passed to the callback function

Widgets which support the `on_change` event:

*   `st.checkbox`
*   `st.color_picker`
*   `st.date_input`
*   `st.data_editor`
*   `st.file_uploader`
*   `st.multiselect`
*   `st.number_input`
*   `st.radio`
*   `st.select_slider`
*   `st.selectbox`
*   `st.slider`
*   `st.text_area`
*   `st.text_input`
*   `st.time_input`
*   `st.toggle`

Widgets which support the `on_click` event:

*   `st.button`
*   `st.download_button`
*   `st.form_submit_button`

To add a callback, define a callback function **above** the widget declaration and pass it to the widget via the `on_change` (or `on_click` ) parameter.

## Forms and Callbacks
Widgets inside a form can have their values be accessed and set via the Session State API. `st.form_submit_button` can have a callback associated with it. The callback gets executed upon clicking on the submit button. For example:
```python
def form_callback():
    st.write(st.session_state.my_slider)
    st.write(st.session_state.my_checkbox)

with st.form(key='my_form'):
    slider_input = st.slider('My slider', 0, 10, 5, key='my_slider')
    checkbox_input = st.checkbox('Yes or No', key='my_checkbox')
    submit_button = st.form_submit_button(label='Submit', on_click=form_callback)
```

## Serializable Session State
Serialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the data’s original structure. Python’s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/develop/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream ("pickling") and deserializes the stream into an object ("unpickling").

By default, Streamlit’s [Session State](/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the object’s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.

To that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](/develop/concepts/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:
```toml
# .streamlit/config.toml
[runner]
enforceSerializableSessionState = true
```
By "_pickle-serializable_", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/develop/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,
```python
import streamlit as st

def unserializable_data():
    return lambda x: x

# results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on
st.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()
```

### Warning
When `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` is set to `true`, Session State implicitly uses the `pickle` module, which is known to be insecure. Ensure all data saved and retrieved from Session State is trusted because it is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. **Only load data you trust**.

## Caveats and limitations
*   Streamlit Session State is tied to a WebSocket connection. When a user reloads the browser tab or navigates using a Markdown link, the WebSocket connection and the associated Session State data are reset.
    
*   Only the `st.form_submit_button` has a callback in forms. Other widgets inside a form are not allowed to have callbacks.
    
*   `on_change` and `on_click` events are only supported on input type widgets.
    
*   Modifying the value of a widget via the Session state API, after instantiating it, is not allowed and will raise a `StreamlitAPIException`. For example:
    ```python
slider = st.slider(
    label='My Slider',
    min_value=1,
    max_value=10,
    value=5,
    key='my_slider'
)
st.session_state.my_slider = 7
# Throws an exception!
```

*   Setting the widget state via the Session State API and using the `value` parameter in the widget declaration is not recommended, and will throw a warning on the first run. For example:
    ```python
st.session_state.my_slider = 7
slider = st.slider(
    label='Choose a Value',
    min_value=1,
    max_value=10,
    value=5,
    key='my_slider'
)
```

*   Setting the state of button-like widgets: `st.button`, `st.download_button`, and `st.file_uploader` via the Session State API is not allowed. Such type of widgets are by default _False_ and have ephemeral _True_ states which are only valid for a single run. For example:
    ```python
if 'my_button' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.my_button = True
st.button('My button', key='my_button')
# Throws an exception!
```
