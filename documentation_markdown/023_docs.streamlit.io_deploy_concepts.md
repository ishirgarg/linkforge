Deployment Concepts
====================
### Introduction to Deployment Concepts

Learn the fundamental concepts of app deployment. There are three main processes involved in deploying apps:

* Install Python, Streamlit, and other dependencies in your deployment environment.
* Securely handle your secrets and private information.
* Remote start your app using `streamlit run`.

If you're using Streamlit Community Cloud, most of the work will be done for you.
