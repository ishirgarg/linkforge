# Install Streamlit
There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit. Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most common scenario.

### Tip
Try a Streamlit Playground that runs in your browser â€” no installation required. (Note that this is not how Streamlit is meant to be used, because it has many downsides. That's why it's a _playground_!)
