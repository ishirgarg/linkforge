# Streamlit in Snowflake
Streamlit provides a seamless way to host your apps alongside your data in a single, global platform. Snowflake offers industry-leading features that ensure the highest levels of security for your account, users, data, and apps.

## Streamlit in Snowflake Quickstart

## Hosting Streamlit Apps in Snowflake
There are three ways to host Streamlit apps in Snowflake:

1. **Streamlit in Snowflake**: Run your Streamlit app as a native object in Snowflake. This option provides an in-browser editor and minimal work to configure your environment. You can share your app with other users in your Snowflake account through role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, check out the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/streamlit/about-streamlit).
2. **Snowflake Native Apps**: Package your app with data and share it with other Snowflake accounts. This is a great way to share apps and their underlying data with other organizations that use Snowflake. For more information, check out the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/native-apps/adding-streamlit).
3. **Snowpark Container Services**: Deploy your app in a container that's optimized to run in Snowflake. This option provides the most flexibility, allowing you to use any library and assign a public URL to your app. You can manage your allowed viewers through your Snowflake account. For more information, check out the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview).

### Note
Using Snowpark Container Services to deploy a Streamlit app requires a compute pool, which is not available in a trial account at this time.
