# First Steps Building Streamlit Apps
=====================================

## Introduction
---------------

If you've just read through our [Basic concepts](/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts) and want to get your hands on Streamlit, check out these tutorials. Make sure you have [installed Streamlit](/get-started/installation) so you can execute the code yourself.

## Tutorials
------------

We have two tutorials to help you get started with building Streamlit apps:

*   [Create an app](/get-started/tutorials/create-an-app): This tutorial uses the concepts learned in Fundamentals along with caching to walk through making your first app.
*   [Create a multipage app](/get-started/tutorials/create-a-multipage-app): This tutorial walks through the easy steps to add pages to your app.
