# Layouts and Containers

This section of the Streamlit API reference covers elements that help you structure your application's layout and organize content into containers.

**URL:** https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout

## Complex layouts

This part of the documentation will detail how to create complex layouts using Streamlit.

---

**(This is the first part of the content. The next part will continue with specific layout elements.)**

### Columns

Insert containers laid out as side-by-side columns.

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
col1.write("this is column 1")
col2.write("this is column 2")
```

### Container

Insert a multi-element container.

```python
c = st.container()
st.write("This will show last")
c.write("This will show first")
c.write("This will show second")
```

### Modal dialog

Insert a modal dialog that can rerun independently from the rest of the script.

```python
@st.dialog("Sign up")
def email_form():
    name = st.text_input("Name")
    email = st.text_input("Email")
```

### Empty

Insert a single-element container.

```python
c = st.empty()
st.write("This will show last")
c.write("This will be replaced")
c.write("This will show first")
```

### Expander

Insert a multi-element container that can be expanded/collapsed.

```python
with st.expander("Open to see more"):
    st.write("This is more content")
```

### Popover

Insert a multi-element popover container that can be opened/closed.

```python
with st.popover("Settings"):
    st.checkbox("Show completed")
```

### Sidebar

Display items in a sidebar.

```python
st.sidebar.write("This lives in the sidebar")
st.sidebar.button("Click me!")
```

### Tabs

Insert containers separated into tabs.

```python
tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Tab 1", "Tab2"])
tab1.write("this is tab 1")
tab2.write("this is tab 2")
```
