### Parameters

*   **data** (Anything supported by `st.dataframe`)

    Data to be plotted.

*   **x** (str or None)

    Column name or key associated to the x-axis data. If `x` is None (default), Streamlit uses the data index for the x-axis values.

*   **y** (str, Sequence of str, or None)

    Column name(s) or key(s) associated to the y-axis data. If this is None (default), Streamlit draws the data of all remaining columns as data series. If this is a Sequence of strings, Streamlit draws several series on the same chart by melting your wide-format table into a long-format table behind the scenes.

*   **x_label** (str or None)

    The label for the x-axis. If this is None (default), Streamlit will use the column name specified in `x` if available, or else no label will be displayed.

*   **y_label** (str or None)

    The label for the y-axis. If this is None (default), Streamlit will use the column name(s) specified in `y` if available, or else no label will be displayed.

*   **color** (str, tuple, Sequence of str, Sequence of tuple, or None)

    The color to use for different series in this chart.

    For a bar chart with just one series, this can be:

    *   None, to use the default color.
    *   A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088".
    *   An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to 1.0.

    For a bar chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in long format (that is, `y` is None or just one column), this can be:

    *   None, to use the default colors.
    *   The name of a column in the dataset. Data points will be grouped into series of the same color based on the value of this column. In addition, if the values in this column match one of the color formats above (hex string or color tuple), then that color will be used.

        For example: if the dataset has 1000 rows, but this column only contains the values "adult", "child", and "baby", then those 1000 datapoints will be grouped into three series whose colors will be automatically selected from the default palette.

        But, if for the same 1000-row dataset, this column contained the values "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff", then then those 1000 datapoints would still be grouped into 3 series, but their colors would be "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff" this time around.

    For a bar chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in wide format (that is, `y` is a Sequence of columns), this can be:

    *   None, to use the default colors.
    *   A list of string colors or color tuples to be used for each of the series in the chart. This list should have the same length as the number of y values (e.g. `color=["#fd0", "#f0f", "#04f"]` for three lines).

    You can set the default colors in the `theme.chartCategoryColors` configuration option.

*   **horizontal** (bool)

    Whether to make the bars horizontal. If this is False (default), the bars display vertically. If this is True, Streamlit swaps the x-axis and y-axis and the bars display horizontally.

*   **sort** (bool or str)

    How to sort the bars. This can be one of the following:

    *   True (default): The bars are sorted automatically along the independent/categorical axis with Altair's default sorting. This also correctly sorts ordered categorical columns (pd.Categorical).
    *   False: The bars are shown in data order without sorting.
    *   The name of a column (e.g. "col1"): The bars are sorted by that column in ascending order.
    *   The name of a column with a minus-sign prefix (e.g. "-col1"): The bars are sorted by that column in descending order.

*   **stack** (bool, "normalize", "center", "layered", or None)

    Whether to stack the bars. If this is None (default), Streamlit uses Vega's default. Other values can be as follows:

    *   True: The bars form a non-overlapping, additive stack within the chart.
    *   False: The bars display side by side.
    *   "layered": The bars overlap each other without stacking.
    *   "normalize": The bars are stacked and the total height is normalized to 100% of the height of the chart.
    *   "center": The bars are stacked and shifted to center the total height around an axis.

*   **width** (int or None)

    Desired width of the chart expressed in pixels. If width is None (default), Streamlit sets the width of the chart to fit its contents according to the plotting library, up to the width of the parent container. If width is greater than the width of the parent container, Streamlit sets the chart width to match the width of the parent container.

    To use width, you must set `use_container_width=False`.

*   **height** (int or None)

    Desired height of the chart expressed in pixels. If height is None (default), Streamlit sets the height of the chart to fit its contents according to the plotting library.

*   **use_container_width** (bool)

    Whether to override width with the width of the parent container. If `use_container_width` is True (default), Streamlit sets the width of the chart to match the width of the parent container. If `use_container_width` is False, Streamlit sets the chart's width according to `width`.

#### Examples

**Example 1: Basic bar chart from a dataframe**

If you don't use any of the optional parameters, Streamlit plots each column as a series of bars, uses the index as the x values, and labels each series with the column name:

```python
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df = pd.DataFrame(rng(0).standard_normal((20, 3)), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.bar_chart(df)
```

**Example 2: Bar chart from specific dataframe columns**

You can choose different columns to use for the x and y values. If your dataframe is in long format (all y-values in one column), you can set the bar colors from another column.

If the column contains color strings, the colors will be applied directly and the series will be unlabeled. If the column contains other values, those values will label each series, and the bar colors will be selected from the default color palette. You can configure this color palette in the `theme.chartCategoryColors` configuration option.

```python
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "col1": list(range(20)) * 3,
        "col2": rng(0).standard_normal(60),
        "col3": ["a"] * 20 + ["b"] * 20 + ["c"] * 20,
    }
)

st.bar_chart(df, x="col1", y="col2", color="col3")
```

**Example 3: Bar chart from wide-format dataframe**

If your dataframe is in wide format (y-values are in multiple columns), you can pass a list of columns to the `y` parameter. Each column name becomes a series label. To override the default colors, pass a list of colors to the `color` parameter, one for each series:
```


```markdown
```python
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "col1": list(range(20)),
        "col2": rng(0).standard_normal(20),
        "col3": rng(1).standard_normal(20),
    }
)

st.bar_chart(
    df,
    x="col1",
    y=["col2", "col3"],
    color=["#FF0000", "#0000FF"],
)
```

### Example 4: Horizontal bar chart

You can use the `horizontal` parameter to display horizontal bars instead of vertical bars. This is useful when you have long labels on the x-axis, or when you want to display a large number of categories. This example requires `vega_datasets` to be installed.

```python
import streamlit as st
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.barley()

st.bar_chart(source, x="variety", y="yield", color="site", horizontal=True)
```

### Example 5: Unstacked bar chart

You can configure the stacking behavior of the bars by setting the `stack` parameter. Set it to `False` to display bars side by side. This example requires `vega_datasets` to be installed.

```python
import streamlit as st
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.barley()

st.bar_chart(source, x="year", y="yield", color="site", stack=False)
```

## element.add_rows

Concatenate a dataframe to the bottom of the current one.

### Function signature [[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.50.0/lib/streamlit/elements/arrow.py#L866 "View st.add_rows source code on GitHub")

```
element.add_rows(data=None, **kwargs)
```

### Parameters

*   **data** (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, Iterable, dict, or None)
    Table to concat. Optional.
*   **\*\*kwargs** (pandas.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, Iterable, dict, or None)
    The named dataset to concat. Optional. You can only pass in 1 dataset (including the one in the data parameter).

#### Example

```python
import time
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from numpy.random import default_rng as rng

df1 = pd.DataFrame(
    rng(0).standard_normal(size=(50, 20)), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20))
)

df2 = pd.DataFrame(
    rng(1).standard_normal(size=(50, 20)), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20))
)

my_table = st.table(df1)
time.sleep(1)
my_table.add_rows(df2)
```

You can do the same thing with plots. For example, if you want to add more data to a line chart:

```python
# Assuming df1 and df2 from the example above still exist...
my_chart = st.line_chart(df1)
time.sleep(1)
my_chart.add_rows(df2)
```

And for plots whose datasets are named, you can pass the data with a keyword argument where the key is the name:

```python
my_chart = st.vega_lite_chart(
    {
        "mark": "line",
        "encoding": {"x": "a", "y": "b"},
        "datasets": {
            "some_fancy_name": df1,  # <-- named dataset
        },
        "data": {"name": "some_fancy_name"},
    }
)
my_chart.add_rows(some_fancy_name=df2)  # <-- name used as keyword
```
