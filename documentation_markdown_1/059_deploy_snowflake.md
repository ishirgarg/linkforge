## Hosting Options

There are three ways to host Streamlit apps in Snowflake:

### 1. Streamlit in Snowflake

Run your Streamlit app as a native object in Snowflake. Enjoy an in-browser editor and minimal work to configure your environment. Share your app with other users in your Snowflake account through role-based access control (RBAC). This is a great way to deploy apps internally for your business.

### 2. Snowflake Native Apps

Package your app with data and share it with other Snowflake accounts. This is a great way to share apps and their underlying data with other organizations who use Snowflake.

### 3. Snowpark Container Services

Deploy your app in a container that's optimized to run in Snowflake. This is the most flexible option, where you can use any library and assign a public URL to your app. Manage your allowed viewers through your Snowflake account.

**Note:** Using Snowpark Container Services to deploy a Streamlit app requires a compute pool, which is not available in a trial account at this time.
