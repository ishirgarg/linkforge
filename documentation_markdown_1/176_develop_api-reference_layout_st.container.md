## st.container
```


Inserts an invisible container into your app that can be used to hold multiple elements. This allows you to, for example, insert multiple elements into your app out of order.

To add elements to the returned container, you can use the `with` notation (preferred) or just call commands directly on the returned object. See examples below.

#### Function signature

```python
st.container(*, border=None, key=None, width="stretch", height="content", horizontal=False, horizontal_alignment="left", vertical_alignment="top", gap="small")
```

#### Parameters

*   **border** (`bool` or `None`): Whether to show a border around the container. If `None` (default), a border is shown if the container is set to a fixed height and not shown otherwise.
*   **key** (`str` or `None`): An optional string to give this container a stable identity. Additionally, if `key` is provided, it will be used as CSS class name prefixed with `st-key-`.
*   **width** (`"stretch"` or `int`): The width of the container. This can be one of the following:
    *   `"stretch"` (default): The width of the container matches the width of the parent container.
    *   An integer specifying the width in pixels: The container has a fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of the parent container, the width of the container matches the width of the parent container.
*   **height** (`"content"`, `"stretch"`, or `int`): The height of the container. This can be one of the following:
    *   `"content"` (default): The height of the container matches the height of its content.
    *   `"stretch"`: The height of the container matches the height of its content or the height of the parent container, whichever is larger. If the container is not in a parent container, the height of the container matches the height of its content.
    *   An integer specifying the height in pixels: The container has a fixed height. If the content is larger than the specified height, scrolling is enabled.

    **Note:** Use scrolling containers sparingly. If you use scrolling containers, avoid heights that exceed 500 pixels. Otherwise, the scroll surface of the container might cover the majority of the screen on mobile devices, which makes it hard to scroll the rest of the app.
*   **horizontal** (`bool`): Whether to use horizontal flexbox layout. If this is `False` (default), the container's elements are laid out vertically. If this is `True`, the container's elements are laid out horizontally and will overflow to the next line if they don't fit within the container's width.
*   **horizontal\_alignment** (`"left"`, `"center"`, `"right"`, or `"distribute"`): The horizontal alignment of the elements inside the container. This can be one of the following:
    *   `"left"` (default): Elements are aligned to the left side of the container.
    *   `"center"`: Elements are horizontally centered inside the container.
    *   `"right"`: Elements are aligned to the right side of the container.
    *   `"distribute"`: Elements are distributed evenly in the container. This increases the horizontal gap between elements to fill the width of the container. A standalone element is aligned to the left.

        When `horizontal` is `False`, `"distribute"` aligns the elements the same as `"left"`.
*   **vertical\_alignment** (`"top"`, `"center"`, `"bottom"`, or `"distribute"`): The vertical alignment of the elements inside the container. This can be one of the following:
    *   `"top"` (default): Elements are aligned to the top of the container.
    *   `"center"`: Elements are vertically centered inside the container.
    *   `"bottom"`: Elements are aligned to the bottom of the container.
    *   `"distribute"`: Elements are distributed evenly in the container. This increases the vertical gap between elements to fill the height of the container. A standalone element is aligned to the top.

        When `horizontal` is `True`, `"distribute"` aligns the elements the same as `"top"`.
*   **gap** (`"small"`, `"medium"`, `"large"`, or `None`): The minimum gap size between the elements inside the container. This can be one of the following:
    *   `"small"` (default): 1rem gap between the elements.
    *   `"medium"`: 2rem gap between the elements.
    *   `"large"`: 4rem gap between the elements.
    *   `None`: No gap between the elements.

    The `rem` unit is relative to the `theme.baseFontSize` configuration option.

    The minimum gap applies to both the vertical and horizontal gaps between the elements. Elements may have larger gaps in one direction if you use a distributed horizontal alignment or fixed height.

#### Examples

**Example 1: Inserting elements using `with` notation**

You can use the `with` statement to insert any element into a container.

```python
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

with st.container():
    st.write("This is inside the container")

    # You can call any Streamlit command, including custom components:
    st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(50, 3))

st.write("This is outside the container")
```

**Example 2: Inserting elements out of order**

When you create a container, its position in the app remains fixed and you can add elements to it at any time. This allows you to insert elements out of order in your app. You can also write to the container by calling commands directly on the container object.

```python
import streamlit as st

container = st.container(border=True)
container.write("This is inside the container")
st.write("This is outside the container")

container.write("This is inside too")
```

**Example 3: Grid layout with columns and containers**

You can create a grid with a fixed number of elements per row by using columns and containers.

```python
import streamlit as st

row1 = st.columns(3)
row2 = st.columns(3)

for col in row1 + row2:
    tile = col.container(height=120)
    tile.title(":balloon:")
```

**Example 4: Vertically scrolling container**

You can create a vertically scrolling container by setting a fixed height.

```python
import streamlit as st

long_text = "Lorem ipsum. " * 1000

with st.container(height=300):
    st.markdown(long_text)
```

**Example 5: Horizontal container**

You can create a row of widgets using a horizontal container. Use `horizontal_alignment` to specify the alignment of the elements.

```python
import streamlit as st

flex = st.container(horizontal=True, horizontal_alignment="right")

for card in range(3):
    flex.button(f"Button {card + 1}")
```
